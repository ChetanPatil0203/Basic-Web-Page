# Basic-Web-Page
First task as an Apexplanet intern, I created a basic webpage using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Through this, I learned how to build clean, visually appealing, and functional web pages. This task strengthened my foundation in front-end development and enhanced my practical skills.
